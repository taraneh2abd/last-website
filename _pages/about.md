Hi there! 👋


📚  I'm a Bachelor's student in Computer Engineering at [University of Science and Technology](http://ce-inter.iust.ac.ir/).

👨🏻‍💻 My Research interests:
  - **Machine Learning** (ML)
  - **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)
  - **Explainable AI** (XAI)

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am deeply passionate about teaching mathematics and have actively engaged in imparting this knowledge to others. My commitment to the fields of mathematical algorithm design stems from a profound interest in the transformative potential of these disciplines.

Beyond the academic sphere, I have cultivated professional expertise in swimming, chess, and piano.
