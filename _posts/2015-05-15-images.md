Fractals, a fascinating concept in mathematics, art, and nature, are intricate geometric patterns that repeat at different scales. The term "fractal" was coined by mathematician Beno√Æt Mandelbrot in 1975, derived from the Latin word "fractus," meaning broken or fragmented.

Fractals exhibit self-similarity, where each part resembles the whole, regardless of the level of magnification. This property distinguishes them from traditional geometric shapes and makes them a unique and captivating subject of study.
