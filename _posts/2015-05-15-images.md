# Euler's Totient Function

Euler's Totient Function, denoted as \( \phi(n) \), is a number theory function that counts the positive integers up to a given integer \( n \) that are relatively prime to \( n \). In other words, \( \phi(n) \) is the count of numbers less than or equal to \( n \) that do not share any common factors (other than 1) with \( n \).

The formula for Euler's Totient Function is given by:

\[
\phi(n) = n \prod_{p|n} \left(1 - \frac{1}{p}\right)
\]

where the product is taken over all distinct prime numbers \( p \) that divide \( n \). This formula essentially calculates \( \phi(n) \) by considering the contributions of all prime factors of \( n \).

Euler's Totient Function has various applications in number theory and cryptography, particularly in RSA encryption, where it plays a crucial role in determining the security of the algorithm.

## Properties of Euler's Totient Function

1. **Multiplicativity Property**: For coprime integers \( m \) and \( n \), we have \( \phi(mn) = \phi(m) \cdot \phi(n) \).
2. **Prime Numbers**: For a prime number \( p \), \( \phi(p) = p - 1 \).
3. **Product of Primes**: For distinct primes \( p \) and \( q \), \( \phi(pq) = (p-1)(q-1) \).
4. **Euler's Theorem**: For any integer \( a \) coprime to \( n \), \( a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \mod n \).

These properties make Euler's Totient Function a powerful tool in number theory with applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science.
